## Everything you need to know to start building for the decentralized web

### What will I¬†learn?¬†

* The fundamentals of the decentralized web, including concepts such as content addressing, distributed data structures, peer-to-peer communication, etc
* A deep understanding of the Interplanetary File System's (IPFS) core components, including the core protocols, conventions, and libraries use to access IPFS
* How to develop a distributed application (ƒêapp), all the way from creating a blank project to deploying it online
* The technical skills needed to interact with decentralized data storage and access, including a specific understanding of adding, pinning, and accessing data on IPFS
* How to combine the right tools to put together a consistent and real world pragmatic Node development environment
* How to deploy a decentralized app to the Interplanetary File System, making it available to the wider public

### Description

Interest in the decentralized web has reached a fever pitch. And with increased concerns over consumer privacy, access, and new regulatory actions, organizations are exploring decentralized applications as a viable development process. But what does it mean to decentralize storage, services, or processes? What tools and/or concepts do we need to be aware of in order to be ready for this brave new world? This course will provide answers to these questions by providing a complete introduction to decentralized application (ƒêapp) development on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). By the end of this course, you will have a working understanding of the decentralized web in general, and the specific tools and technologies needed to interact with IPFS more specifically.

### Who is the target audience?

Anybody with a little bit of backend and/or frontend software development‚Ää-‚Ääa seasoned developer with an interest in learning about the decentralized web, or a total beginner looking to develop new skills in an exciting area of web-development.

### Requirements

* You should already have developed a couple of software applications, backend, frontend or both
* You need a Mac, Linux or Windows 10 machine to develop the sample application
* You should also be comfortable working on the command-line
* A basic understanding of a programming language like Javascript is definitely a plus üëç
